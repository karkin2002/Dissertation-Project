    "This jupyter notebook is authored by Kaya Arkin (Stu No. 2105361) as part of their Swansea University final year project *\"Exploratory Research on Explainable LLMs (Airbus AI Research)\"*. The project is supervised by Mark Hall, an employee at the Airbus AI Research Department, and Bertie Muller, a university assigned supervisor. The project aims *\"to provide an insightful set of findings and recommendations on fine-turned local explanations for LLMs that can utilised as resource for future explainability implementations\"* tailored towards Airbus AI Research.\n",

    "THe jupyter notebook provides an example of the fine-tuned LLM predicting a part failure for a given report. In this example, the fine-tuned model is loaded, an input is tokenised and fed into the model which outputs a predicted response.\n",
